# Unraveling the Dynamics of Airfare Price Predictions
This is the capstone project for the University of San Diegoâ€™s ADS 599 Capstone Project course.
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Description
This project tackles issues of airfare uncertainty and limited filtering options in flight aggregation apps. We focus on two main objectives: predicting airfare changes over time and correlating airfare prices with desired amenities. For the first objective, we assist customers in predicting price changes within one day, one week, and one month. This empowers travelers with insights for making informed decisions on when to book flights. The second objective addresses the challenge of limited filtering options for specific features. Leveraging machine learning, our model helps users predict how airfare prices correlate with desired amenities, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between ticket prices and specific features.
